description: How to commit changes to the repository
---
This workflow executes git commands to stage and commit changes.

1. Check git status to see modified files
```shell
git status
```
2. Stage all modifications
```shell
git add .
```
3. Commit with a descriptive message
```shell
git commit -m "Auto-commit: Provide descriptive message here"
```
